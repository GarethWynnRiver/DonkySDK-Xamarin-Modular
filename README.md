# Donky Modular SDK (V2.2.0)

The modular SDK exposes all of the network functionality in a way that means integrators can consume only the pieces they need in order to:

<ul>
<li>Send custom notifications</li>
<li>Use Donky's messaging features</li>
<li>Automate actions and messaging</li>
<li>Track in app analytics</li>
<li>Build complex M2M, A2P and P2P applications</li>
</ul>

Using Donky as a data network allows developers to focus on writing the apps code rather than having to worry about building a reliable and secure network. The complexities of transferring data across the internet are taken care of, allowing developers to just build their applications.

##Requirements

The minimal technical requirements for the Donky's Xamarin Modular SDK are:

<ul>
<li>Xamarin Platform, available at https://xamarin.com/platform</li>
<li>Either:<br />
<ul>
<li>Xamarin Studio (installed as part of the platform download), or</li>
<li>Visual Studio Community Edition 2013 or 2015, available at https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
